# SIFT Implementation
This is a basic implementation of the SIFT Algorithm. 

Scale Invariant Feature Transform is an image descriptor used to define keypoints in an image. It creates a descriptor of an image. The keypoints and descriptors help in image matching and can be used for a large variety of purposes in the field of Computer Vision.
